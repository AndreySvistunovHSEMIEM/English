1) **So, yeah**. At the last lesson we were talking about quadrobics, but I can add the other one - gambling. This is catching fire phenomena where every person should be rich at some point. Do you know, that gambling is healthy for you, because we have statistic that shows us count of dying: 1 million dying from smoking every year, 3 more million dying from alcohol abuse, but no one, no one have ever died from gambling. This is because gambling is healthy for you and this is a fundamental thing people need to live.

2) **Well, there** is only one option - GAMBLING! But we are so serious people and I have to answer you the same way. So, got to admit that I am not a both nervous and furious person and I've never been at the situation like in the answer, because I have a stable mind, but if we are going to imagine this situation, I would like to meet with my closest friends, discuss it with them, and after this crisis we will develop a company "Meme dogs" and we will dive in with both feet!

3) **No**, I'm not going to be part of any subculture, because I believe in Russia, in the Motherland, and no organization will sag me off.

4) **I guess** it would be helpful for me to brush up on both articles and mixed conditionals (actually, I don't know the real name of this theme);

5) Strange question, but we're here to practice our English, and I'm going to present the situation again. Yes, 7 years ago I had a friend Joe who was such an angry and anxious person. I didn't know what his problem was, but it was an outstanding trait of his mind and my gut feeling told me that I needed to stop communicating with him, and then I heard the following: A little boy from Grove Street killed everyone around him (mother, father, brother, etc.), even himself.... So where is the alarm sounding? I spoke to parents and teachers beforehand, but no one believed me, and it's so sad....
