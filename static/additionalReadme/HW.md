1) **So, yeah**. At the last lesson we were talking about quadrobics, but I can add the other one - gambling. This is catching fire phenomena where every person should be rich at some point. Do you know, that gambling is healthy for you, because we have statistic that shows us count of dying: 1 million dying from smoking every year, 3 more million dying from alcohol abuse, but no one, no one have ever died from gambling. This is because gambling is healthy for you and this is a fundamental thing people need to live.

2) **Well, there** is only one option - GAMBLING! But we are so serious people and I have to answer you the same way. So, got to admit that I am not a both nervous and furious person and I've never been at the situation like in the answer, because I have a stable mind, but if we are going to imagine this situation, I would like to meet with my closest friends, discuss it with them, and after this crisis we will develop a company "Meme dogs" and we will dive in with both feet!

3) **No**, I'm not going to be part of any subculture, because I believe in Russia, in the Motherland, and no organization will sag me off.

---

4) **I guess** it would be helpful for me to brush up on both articles and mixed conditionals (actually, I don't know the real name of this theme);

---

5) Strange question, but we're here to practice our English, and I'm going to present the situation again. Yes, 7 years ago I had a friend Joe who was such an angry and anxious person. I didn't know what his problem was, but it was an outstanding trait of his mind and my gut feeling told me that I needed to stop communicating with him, and then I heard the following: A little boy from Grove Street killed everyone around him (mother, father, brother, etc.), even himself.... So where is the alarm sounding? I spoke to parents and teachers beforehand, but no one believed me, and it's so sad....

1) **I can remember** only my first time at dormitory. I like to bother and irritate people from time to time because I find it so funny. However, at some point, I got into troubles because I sicked someone and after that I had to apologize and bring a several cheapy gifts.

2) **Last time** I had to give a slap on the wrist when I had received a group project at the end of deadline. It hardly worked and looked like a huddle of weirdos had done it. I slapped them all and finished it on time. In the end we got a good mark, but I promise that I won't trust them at all.

3) **So, these** were my exams that eventually helped me to enter the university. I remember being afraid of bad results because my parents said me that I would have to pay for my education by myself, regardless of whether it was the government support or my own funds. And in the end, I managed and I'am studying at HSE.

4) **I can't say** it was an arrogant person, but it was strange passerby. He wasn't sober and he had a terrible smell. While as I was getting off the bus, he gave me a couple of insults because I had looked at him. I gave him a finger and this is the end of this rather exciting story. 

5) **I think** this story is so usual for all of us, because it's a typical for our lifestyle. Of course, I remember these moments, although there were a lot. I can't bear if anyone complaint about the other person without any reasons and it's so hard to stay calm. I remember school days, even elementary school. For example, someone had spilled a water on the floor and my classmate pointed the finger at me, though I wasn't.

6) **Oh**, there have been plenty of situations where strangers have patted me on the back because I can easily get along with people and take a fluent and calm conversations. The last time this happened was at the beginning of my second year at university. I was hanging around the smoking area, talking with my mates about‚Ä¶ No, I won‚Äôt share that piece of nonsense. After a while, someone asked us about university matters, and we had a brief conversation about business. Then he patted me on the back and gave me a phone number because I supported him and came up with useful ideas.
